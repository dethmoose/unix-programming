Testing server combinations of request strategy and daemon/not daemon.

Checking processes with htop and 'ps axj'
Checking zombie processes with top
Writing result status as P=pass, F=fail

-----------------------------------------------------------------

[ P ] 	STRAT=FORK, 	DAEMON=FALSE
Sending input to server and sending results to client:      works
Handling several concurrent clients:                        works
Zombie processes:                                           no

-----------------------------------------------------------------

[ F ] 	STRAT=FORK, 	DAEMON=TRUE
Sending input to server and sending results to client:      FAIL! (works in some cases)
Handling several concurrent clients:                        works
Zombie processes:                                           no



Clients get stuck between receiving solution filename and getting the next "Enter a command" prompt. 
In htop daemon processes are left but never getting any more uptime (blocking waiting for client?). 
Not the correct output files created (client3 dir empty, no kmeans_client3_soln files created). 
A single client connected to the daemon server can command "kmeans", it works fine. 
When multiple clients connected to daemon server (or when client_num>1?) commanding "kmeans" gets the client stuck.

Notes: 

* Save the "Received the solution" print until last, to not cause uncertainty whether the program is stuck or just computing?

* Remove "Closing socket" print server?

* Look into daemon server + "kmeans" (without options). 
  When d=0, "kmeans" and kmeans with -f works the same, both generates solution files and the server is responsive to client.
  When d=1, "kmeans" without options causes the server to never write any data from kmeans. Does the 'popen' call fail?
  How to debug daemon processes? There were no errors logged to /var/log/syslog.
